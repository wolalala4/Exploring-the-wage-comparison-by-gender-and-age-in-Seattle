# Exploring-the-wage-comparison-by-gender-and-age-in-Seattle
Before the experiment, we want to introduce why we choose this topic. We all know  that gender is one of the biggest issues in global. Too many people are working for  balanced the difference between male and female. And, for preparing this project, we  searched a lot of articles. Then, we found an interesting article which called “Moms  Work 5 Extra Months to Earn as Much as Dads, Research Says”. The title tells us a  truth about real life, the wage of female always lower than male. But we cannot just  trust author’s words, we need to analysis by ourselves. And, unifies own actual situation,  we are junior and senior student, which means we will graduate in next year or next  semester. Thus, we consider about a lot of things around jobs. Wage is one of the most  important elements, then, we search the data from Seattle government website which  offer us a set of data about wage in different ages and different gender. And, because,  in our group we male group member and female group member. We are interested in  the different between the wage of female and the wage of male. We will use the  randomly completely block design to help us finish this experiment.
